# RunLambda
A boto3 python program to test out invoking Lambda functions from your local machine
## Quick start guide
You will need Python3 to run this program, boto3 is the only other dependency needed to run this program, you can install it with `pip install boto3` although I put in a requirements.txt file so you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` as well
